                    the extent that you have declared that your donations are eligible donations under the HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) Gift Aid scheme, TEVINI will make a claim for basic rate tax from HMRC as permitted by law, and will apply the amount received from HMRC to your Notional Account as if it were a donation of funds to TEVINI. You are responsible for verifying whether or not and the extent to which your donations are eligible under the HMRC Gift Aid Scheme. To the extent that TEVINI apply for and/or receive an amount from HMRC in respect of your donations and such amount is found to have been received in error, TEVINI will be entitled to deduct any such sums from your Notional Account or to require you to make such payment to your Notional Account as may be required to rectify such error. Claims for tax rebates to HMRC are usually submitted monthly and tax credits are shown on statements once the funds have been received by TEVINI. This normally takes one week from the time the claim is submitted but can take longer.
